            Hey, I'm Pascal Huber, a frontend developer from Lachen,
            Switzerland. Welcome to my portfolio page, where I provide an
            insight into my journey through the world of web development. My
            passion lies in creating appealing user interfaces and user-friendly
            websites. In my work as a frontend developer, I strive for clean
            code and functional designs.
